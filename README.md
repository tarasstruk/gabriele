# Gabriele

100% 🦀 Rust command-line interface for TA Gabriele 9009 Typewriter.

This package provides a command-line tool for electronic typewriters with UART interface
manufactured by Triumph-Adler in 1980-1990. Package is tested with Gabriele 9009.
It may work also work fine with similar Triumph-Adler devices and IBM Action Writer 6715.

## Features

- [x] abstraction layer for TA Gabriele 9009 serial port connection and the mission-critical low level commands;
- [x] typewriter's coordinate system and basic printing logic, including the carriage return;
- [x] printing of text files;
- [x] printing of composite UTF-8 characters which don't exist on the physical daisy wheel (like "é");
- [x] impression compensation;
- [ ] hot-swap daisy wheels;
- [ ] bidirectional printing;
- [ ] proportional characters;
- [ ] bold characters;
- [ ] command-line "native" typewriter mode;

## Connecting the typewriter to a computer

The typewriters data interface is based on UART specification. It was designed to communicate with a host computer
through vendor-specific interface box "IFD 1". 
 
The idea of the project is to connect our computer "directly" and drive the typewriter with its native 2-bytes 
commands. However, there are still some [hardware obstacles to overcome](/docs/README.md).

A new way of communication to the machine is https://github.com/tarasstruk/gabriele-embassy
It provides an abstraction layer and facilitates the physical connection to Gabriele.
The feedback is based on the echo principle: a byte transmitted, the same is received.

## Running the app

```sh
# print from the STDIN (interactive mode):
cargo run -- --ip 192.168.0.11
# print a text file:
cargo run -- --ip 192.168.0.11 --text welcome.txt
# or with debug output:
RUST_LOG=DEBUG cargo run -- --ip 192.168.0.11
```

### Using directives in the interactive mode

`@>daisy`: This directive loads the daisy wheel data from a disk file.
The physical wheel at this point can be replaced with a new one.
This feature permits "how swapping" daisy wheels to use different fonts.
It is very useful when the layouts of typefaces are different. The parameter 
specifies a relative or absolute path to the new wheel data file.

```text
@>daisy wheels/German.toml
```

To quit the interactive mode just type `exit` and press return.
